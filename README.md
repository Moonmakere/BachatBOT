## üéØ The Problem: Financial Complexity in India

The Indian financial landscape is a maze of complex products and dense jargon. This leads to:
*   **Poor Planning**: 60% of middle-income earners live paycheck to paycheck, with 45% failing to optimize taxes.
*   **Missed Opportunities**: A significant number of taxpayers overlook major tax-saving options under sections 80C, 80D, 24B, and NPS.
*   **Ineffective Tracking**: 70% of salaried individuals struggle to track expenses, hindering their ability to build wealth.

### Technical Rationale: Why Streamlit?

We chose **Streamlit** for the AI Insurance Advisor to leverage its strengths in rapidly building interactive, data-centric applications. This architectural decision allows us to:

-   **Decouple Specialized Tools:** Keep the main Next.js application lean and focused on core financial management, while offering a powerful, dedicated tool for a specific, complex task like insurance planning.
-   **Accelerate Development:** Quickly iterate on the insurance analysis model and its user interface without needing to redeploy the entire core application.
-   **Provide Rich Interactivity:** Enable complex data visualizations, sliders for risk assessment, and real-time feedback that are native to data science workflows, providing a superior user experience for this specific feature.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

BachatBot employs a robust microservices architecture, separating the frontend presentation layer from the specialized AI/ML backend services. This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and resilience.

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

Our implementation showcases a modern, full-stack approach to building AI applications.

#### 1. Frontend: A Modern, Reactive Experience
-   **Framework**: Built with **Next.js 15** and the App Router, leveraging Server Components for performance and Client Components for interactivity.
-   **State Management**: **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management (e.g., sidebar state), ensuring a predictable and scalable state container.
-   **UI & Styling**: **Tailwind CSS 4** with `tailwind-merge` and `clsx` for a utility-first, conflict-free styling experience. Custom fonts (`ClashDisplay`, `Montserrat`) are loaded via `next/font`.
-   **Animations**: **Framer Motion** is used extensively to create fluid page transitions and micro-interactions, enhancing the user experience.
-   **File Handling**: `react-dropzone` provides a seamless drag-and-drop interface for document uploads.

#### 2. Backend API Gateway & Authentication
-   **Gateway Pattern**: The Next.js API Routes (`/src/app/api`) act as a secure gateway (Backend-for-Frontend), proxying requests to the downstream Python microservices. This simplifies CORS and centralizes API interaction logic.
-   **Authentication**: Secure, token-based authentication is implemented using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** and `bcrypt.js` for password hashing.
-   **Session Management**: JWTs are stored in `HttpOnly` cookies for enhanced security against XSS attacks.
-   **Protected Routes**: The `middleware.js` file intercepts requests to protected pages (`/dashboard`, `/profile`), verifying the JWT cookie before allowing access and redirecting unauthenticated users.

#### 3. AI/ML Microservices (Python, Flask, Express)
-   **Document Intelligence Service (`/OCR`)**: An Express.js server acts as a receiver for file uploads. It uses Node.js's `spawn` to invoke a Python script (`bills_and_expense.py`). The Python script leverages **OpenCV** for image preprocessing and **EasyOCR** for robust text extraction. The raw text is then passed to the **Google Gemini API** for intelligent structuring and JSON conversion.
-   **RAG Tax Chatbot Service (`/ChatBot`)**: A Flask-based service that implements a classic Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.
    -   **Indexing**: Tax law PDFs are loaded using `PyPDFLoader`, split into chunks, and vectorized using **Hugging Face Embeddings** (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
    -   **Storage**: The vectors are stored and indexed in a **FAISS** vector store for fast semantic search.
    -   **Retrieval**: On receiving a query, the service retrieves the most relevant document chunks from FAISS.
    -   **Generation**: The retrieved context and the user's query are passed to an LLM (**OpenAI/Gemini**) via **LangChain** to generate a contextually accurate answer.
-   **Tax & Recommendation Service (`/Rec_Bachat`)**: A Flask service that exposes a `/generate-report` endpoint. It contains the business logic to calculate tax liabilities for both Old and New regimes and then queries the **Google Gemini** API with a structured prompt to generate personalized financial and investment insights.
